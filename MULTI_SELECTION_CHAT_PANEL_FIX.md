# Multi-Node Selection Fix - Chat Panel Issue

## Issue

When Shift+Clicking on a node to add it to the multi-selection, the chat panel was incorrectly opening.

## Root Cause

The `onNodeClick` handler was being triggered on every click, including when the Shift key was held down for multi-selection. ReactFlow handles multi-selection internally, but our custom click handler was interfering with this behavior.

## Solution

Modified the `onNodeClick` handler in all canvas components to check if the Shift key is pressed and return early without triggering the chat panel selection:

```typescript
const onNodeClick = useCallback(
  (event: React.MouseEvent, node: Node) => {
    // Don't open chat panel if Shift is held (multi-selection mode)
    if (event.shiftKey) {
      return;
    }
    onNodeSelect(node.id, node.data.label);
  },
  [onNodeSelect]
);
```

## Files Modified

1. `/components/canvas-area-enhanced.tsx` - Updated `onNodeClick` handler
2. `/components/canvas-area.tsx` - Updated `onNodeClick` handler
3. `/components/canvas-area-smooth.tsx` - Updated `onNodeClick` handler
4. `/MULTI_NODE_SELECTION_GUIDE.md` - Updated documentation

## Testing

After this fix:

- ✅ Normal click on node → Opens chat panel (expected behavior)
- ✅ Shift+Click on node → Adds to selection, no chat panel (fixed!)
- ✅ Shift+Drag → Box selection works without opening chat
- ✅ Drag selected nodes → All move together
- ✅ Click empty area → Deselects all nodes

## Implementation Details

### How it works:

1. When a user clicks on a node, React's MouseEvent is passed to `onNodeClick`
2. We check `event.shiftKey` to see if Shift is being held
3. If Shift is pressed, we return early, allowing ReactFlow to handle the multi-selection
4. If Shift is not pressed, we proceed with normal chat panel opening logic

### Why this approach:

- Non-invasive: Minimal change to existing code
- Consistent: Applied across all canvas variants
- User-friendly: Natural behavior that users expect
- Compatible: Works seamlessly with ReactFlow's built-in selection handling
