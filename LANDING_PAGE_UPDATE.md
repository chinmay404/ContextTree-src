# Landing Page Update - Professional Redesign

## Overview

Completely redesigned the ContextTree landing page to match the existing app's design system and create a professional, clean, minimal aesthetic.

## Key Changes

### Design System Alignment

- **Color Palette**: Changed from gray to slate throughout (slate-50, slate-900, etc.)
- **Rounded Corners**: Updated to rounded-xl and rounded-2xl (from rounded-full/rounded-lg)
- **Typography**: Maintained Inter font with bold weights for headings
- **Shadows**: Enhanced shadow system (shadow-sm, shadow-md, shadow-lg, shadow-xl)
- **Borders**: Consistent border-slate-200/300 throughout

### Navigation

- Added proper routing with `useRouter` from Next.js
- Updated button styles to match app design (rounded-xl with slate colors)
- Better hover states and transitions

### Hero Section

- More impactful heading with better hierarchy
- Updated badge style to match app aesthetic
- Better spacing and visual hierarchy
- Stats bar with proper styling

### Demo Section (Traditional vs ContextTree)

- Enhanced tab switcher with better visual feedback

- Better node visualization in the ContextTree view
- Enhanced hover states and interactions
- Larger, more readable content

### How It Works

- Animated step highlighting (cycles every 3 seconds)

### Use Cases

## Technical Improvements

1. **TypeScript**: Added proper type for `hoveredNode` state
2. **Next.js Integration**: Added `useRouter` for navigation
3. **Accessibility**: Better hover states and focus indicators
4. **Responsive**: Maintained mobile-first responsive design
5. **Performance**: No additional dependencies, pure React

## Design Principles Applied

1. **Consistency**: Every element uses the slate color palette
2. **Hierarchy**: Clear visual hierarchy with font sizes and weights
3. **Spacing**: Generous padding and margins for breathing room
4. **Shadows**: Subtle elevation to create depth
5. **Minimalism**: Clean, focused design without clutter
6. **Interactivity**: Smooth transitions and hover states

## Files Modified

- `/contexttree-landing.tsx` - Complete redesign

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. Add fade-in animations on scroll (AOS or Framer Motion)
2. Add testimonials section if you have user feedback
3. Add FAQ section for common questions
4. Add demo video/GIF in hero section
5. Integrate with actual waitlist API endpoint
6. Add OpenGraph/meta tags for social sharing
7. Add analytics tracking

## How to Use

The landing page now properly routes to `/waitlist` when users click "Get Started" or "Join Beta". Make sure your waitlist page is set up at `/app/waitlist/page.tsx`.

The component can be used standalone or integrated into your existing page structure:

```tsx
import ContextTreeLanding from "@/contexttree-landing";

export default function HomePage() {
  return <ContextTreeLanding />;
}
```
