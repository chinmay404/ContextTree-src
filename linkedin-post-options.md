# LinkedIn Post for ContextTree Waitlist

## Simple & Direct Version

Hey LinkedIn! üëã

I've been working on something I'm excited to share - ContextTree.

It's a visual canvas for building and managing AI conversations with a node-based interface (see the screenshot).

ü§î The problem: AI conversations are hard to debug, context gets messy, and testing changes breaks everything.

üõ†Ô∏è The solution: A visual flow where you can:
- See every conversation branch clearly
- Connect nodes with Fork/Always logic
- Test different LLMs on the same flow
- Never lose track of context again

Currently in beta and looking for early users to join the waitlist!

Would love your feedback and thoughts.

## Version 2: Problem-Solution Focus

üéØ "Your AI conversations are a mess. Here's how we fix it."

After watching countless teams struggle with unmanageable AI conversation flows, we built ContextTree - the first visual canvas for conversation ops.

üî• The reality check:
- Your chatbot conversations drift after 3-4 exchanges
- Debugging why an AI responded a certain way? Good luck.
- Want to test alternatives without breaking production? Not happening.
- Context management? It's basically gambling.

üí° ContextTree changes the game:

üé® Visual Node Canvas - Drag, drop, and connect every conversation turn
üîó Smart Context Linking - Only inherit what each branch actually needs
‚ö° Multi-LLM Comparison - Test GPT vs Claude vs others side-by-side
üîç Complete Traceability - See exactly what context reached each model
üõ°Ô∏è Safe Experimentation - Branch, test, and rollback with confidence

The interface you see here? That's a real conversation flow with Entry Points, Branch Nodes, and Context management that actually works.

We're shipping seamless collaboration and external context nodes next - think knowledge bases and APIs as dedicated nodes in your flow.

üöÄ Beta launching soon. Join the waitlist to be first in line.

## Version 3: Community/Audience Engagement

ü§î Question for the AI community: How do you debug conversation flows that go off the rails?

Been there. Built that. 

Introducing ContextTree - the conversation canvas that makes AI debugging visual and intuitive.

üéØ What you see in this screenshot:
- Every conversation turn as a connected node
- Clear branching paths with Fork/Always logic
- Context inheritance that you can actually trace
- Multi-model comparison in the same flow

This is what happens when you treat conversation design like the complex system it actually is.

üí≠ Key insights from building this:
1. Context drift isn't random - it's architectural
2. Visual representation > text-based conversation logs
3. Branching conversations need branching tools
4. LLM comparison should be built-in, not bolted-on

üî• What's coming next:
- Shared canvases for team collaboration  
- External context nodes (APIs, knowledge bases)
- Advanced prompt templating system

We're in beta and looking for conversation ops pioneers to help shape the roadmap.

Who's tired of conversation chaos and ready for conversation ops? üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
