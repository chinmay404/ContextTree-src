# ContextTree Custom Access URL

## Admin Sign-In Access

**Custom URL for direct sign-in access:**

```
/access/a7f3e9b2-4c8d-4e6f-9a1b-3c7e8f2d1a9e
```

**Full URL (replace with your domain):**

```
https://your-domain.com/access/a7f3e9b2-4c8d-4e6f-9a1b-3c7e8f2d1a9e
```

## Usage

- **Public Landing Page**: Only shows "Join waitlist" button
- **Admin Access**: Use the custom URL above to bypass the landing page and go directly to sign-in
- **User Access**: When you want to allow normal users to sign in, share the custom URL

## Security Notes

- The UUID path is not discoverable from the public landing page
- Keep this URL private until you want to enable user sign-ins
- The URL directly redirects to `/auth/signin`
