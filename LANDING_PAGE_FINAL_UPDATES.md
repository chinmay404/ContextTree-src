# Landing Page Final Updates

- ✅ Fixed redirect loop for favicon and assets

### 2. **Updated Brand Identity**

- ✅ Replaced generic Network icon with your actual brand icon: `/tree-icon.svg`
- ✅ Applied to both navigation and footer

### 3. **Updated Model Names to Reflect Open-Source**

**Old (Generic closed-source):**

### 5. **Design System**

## What This Communicates

### Before:

"We support multiple closed-source LLM providers (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini)"

### After:

"We use 10+ open-source models via Groq - fast, free, and powerful"

## Benefits of This Messaging:

1. **Honest & Transparent** - Shows you're using open-source models
2. **Cost-Effective** - Implies no API costs for users
3. **Fast** - Groq is known for speed
4. **Developer-Friendly** - Open-source appeals to developers
5. **Future-Proof** - Leaves room to add closed-source models later

## To Apply Changes:

1. **Restart dev server** to pick up `.env.local` changes:

   ```bash
   # Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **View landing page** - Logout or open in incognito to see the new landing page

## Next Steps (Optional):

- Add "Powered by Groq" badge/mention for credibility
- Add specific model names in a models showcase section
- Add performance comparison showing Groq's speed advantage
- Consider adding a "Pro" tier for closed-source models (GPT-4, Claude) in the future
