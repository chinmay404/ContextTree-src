# How to Find the Tree Layout Button

## You're Currently On: Canvas List View ❌

The screenshot shows you're on the **canvas list/dashboard page** where you see:

- List of all your canvases (6 total)
- Node previews
- Canvas cards

**The Tree Layout button does NOT appear here** because there are no nodes to arrange on the list view.

## Where the Button Actually Is: Canvas Editor View ✅

### Steps to See the Tree Layout Button:

1. **Click on any canvas** from your list:

   - Click "Thesis" (12 nodes)
   - Or click "New Canvas" (2 nodes)
   - Or any other canvas

2. **Canvas will open in editor mode**

3. **Look at TOP-LEFT corner** - You'll see a **PURPLE gradient button**:

```
┌────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🌐 Tree Layout  ✨ Effects         │ ← HERE!
│                                     │
│     Your canvas nodes appear here  │
│                                     │
└────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## What the Button Looks Like Now:

**NEW APPEARANCE (Very Visible!)**:

- **Color**: Purple-to-indigo gradient background
- **Text**: White "Tree Layout" with Network icon
- **Size**: Regular size (larger than before)
- **Location**: Top-left corner
- **Shadow**: Large shadow for visibility

You **cannot miss it** - it's a bright purple button!

## Why It's Not on the List Page:

The Tree Layout feature:

- Arranges **nodes** in hierarchical structure
- Requires **edges** (connections) between nodes
- Only works **inside a canvas** where nodes exist

The list page:

- Shows canvas **previews** only
- Has no interactive nodes
- Is for **navigation**, not editing

## Quick Test:

1. From your current screen, click **"Thesis"** canvas
2. Canvas editor opens
3. Look at **top-left corner**
4. See bright **PURPLE "Tree Layout"** button
5. Click it to arrange all 12 nodes!

---

**TL;DR**: You need to **open a canvas first**, then you'll see the purple Tree Layout button at the top-left! 🎯
